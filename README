M4C Rating Maplets
==================

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/xanesis4/M4C-Ratings/master/logo.png)

My name is Parth Sarin; and I work in collaboration with a professor at Texas A&M University, Dr. Phillip Yasskin.

Dr. Yasskin is a co-founder of a company called Maplets For Caluclus, which makes applets that teach Calculus to students.

It soon became obvious that people needed to rate these "Maplets", thus I was put to the task of doing it.

The term "Maplet" refers to an Applet written in the programming language Maple.
